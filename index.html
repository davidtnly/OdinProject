					    			<li>Let’s say there is a data question that needs to be answered so we need to identify the schemas (tables). Schema is the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed. First, we would need a database (data warehouse, server, cloud) to store the data.
					    			</li><br>
					    			<li>
					    			A data warehouse can be a computer with 50 harddrives, and Cloud can be the same but has computing (processing) powers. Both of them are just a group of servers. *I use a postgreSQL webfaction server. My database is *ts. There are different types of databases where certain languages are used to access and pull data from. Data is stored into a table that is within a database. There are different types of SQL languages but if you know one, then it is not very difficult to learn the other. For example: English is a widely used language.There is American English, British English, and even Australian English but they all have some differences in their word choices/accents/etc. SQL is the same. After this, we need a front-end platform that is connected to the database to get for the queries to be conversating with into a report.
					    			</li><br>
					    		</ul>
					    		<ul>
									<li>Now, a programmer would find the appropriate site where the data would be found. The analyst would give the programmer the needed definitions of what the data type needs to be to match the schema. Each data point would be stored into a table. These tables would have relations with one another. Finally, an analyst would communicate with the database by a standard language used. By writing queries, data is retrieved and may be exported to various types of formats. Now we have the needed data to be analyzed and presented.
